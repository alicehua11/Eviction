				In this map, I want to understand why people live in San Francisco. How did time-space compression phenomenon transform this city over time?	We all know how expensive it is to live in San Francisco, we know that gentrification is happening, but we don't have the exact geospatial evidence for this occurence in colloquial discourse. Unless...,there is a map that aggregate the data for it.
				<br>
				<br>
				Looking at this map, we can tell that evictions peaked at 1999, what special event that happened then triggered this eviction outburst? Further research leads to the finding that <a href="http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=San_Francisco%27s_Space_Wars_2001"> there was a surge of 130,000 new tech jobs from 1999 to 2000 which immediately intensified the city's housing market shortage.</a><br>
				<br>

				Gentrification is evident through the chloropleth where places of high renters and  tech shuttle stops are usually the areas with the most evictions. More specifically, renters from the Mission District are historically blue-collar workers of the city. They are the ones experiencing the negative effect of time-space compression. The idea of a divided world of social groups, a group that has more power relation to determine their mobility, defined by Doreen Massay as "flows and movement", versus a group who is "effectively imprisioned" by it, has to accept their designated or alienated spaces. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Although San Francisco is eating its own tail by evicting their longtime residents, and making room for the vanguard of tech residents, these evictions also brought together <a href="http://sfadc.org/coalition/"> groups and coalitions </a> standing up against their displacement. Narratives from populations of Latinos, Salvadorans, Nicaraguan, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese,are what shaped San Francisco, historically, socially, culturally today.
				<br>
				<br>
				In <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36206247-pictures-of-a-gone-city">Pictures of a Gone City: Tech and the Dark Side of Prosperity</a></em>, <a href="https://geography.berkeley.edu/richard-walker">Richard Walker</a>, a professor emeritus of Geography at UC Berkeley, exposes the wealth inequality that this time-space compression has birthed, a Marxist concept of "all that is solid melts into air".
