				In this map I want to understand why people live in San Francisco. How did time-space compression phenomenon transform this city over time?	We all know how expensive it is to live in San Francisco, we know that gentrification is happening, but we don't have the exact geospatial evidence for this occurence in colloquial discourse. Unless...there is a map that aggregate the data for it.<br>
				Looking at this map, we can tell that evictions peaked at 1999, what special event that happened then triggered this eviction outburst? Further research leads to the finding that <a style="color:#e20909" href="http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=San_Francisco%27s_Space_Wars_2001"> there was a surge of 130,000 new tech jobs from 1999 to 2000 intensified the city's housing market shortage.</a><br>

				Renters from the Mission District are historically blue-collar workers of the city. 
				The gentrification is evident through the chloropleth where places of high renters are usually the ones to be evicted. The renters are in a sense experiencing a positive feedback loop of time-space compression, where the increasing globalizing world demands for higher urban concentrations in the giant tech city of San Francisco.
